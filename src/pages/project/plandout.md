  A project management tool to share the project timeline with the client
  without sharing too much.
---


At Outthink we used the Project Management tool Asana. While this tool was
great and allowed us to track our progress of the project, it wasnt great at
showing the client where we were in the Project. We could invite the client into
our Asana, but this would give the client too much information, and could slow
down progress. 

We came up with a solution that by using the Asana API, we could have shareable
timelines that add the exact right amount of information we wanted the client to
have. This allowed the client to know when certain things were to be done and
also if there was content that we needed from them.
